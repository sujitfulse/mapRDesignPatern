After riding a day or two, it looks like my tube gets rotated a little inside the tire, and the valve becomes bent. If i continue riding, the tube gets torn. So i have to remove the tire, wiggle the tube a bit, and it's back to normal for a few days.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The tube seems to fit very well, and i don't notice any inconvenience when inserting it, so maybe my problem is not caused by bad tubes (or maybe it is? how can i make sure?)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another thing that might be relevant: i started riding moderately technical terrain in the last year (going down rocky roads, riding downstairs in the city). The problems started just a month ago; maybe the additional stress, combined with the warm weather (25-30Â°C now), is the cause?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I also use &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.decathlon.co.uk/anti-puncture-tape-x2-id_8005966.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;anti-puncture tape&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, what causes my problem?
