For example, it found some old emails that were sent to a mailing list address that had `To:users-sc.1234567.abcdefg-bob=gmail.com@spamassassin.apache.org`. That implies to me that Gmail could find the individual words inside the To: addresses, but when there's a + between them, it's somehow making them atoms (binding them).

When you enter a query like the one you suggest Google returns a collection of pages. Many of them will come from the principal job sites such as monster.com or indeed.ca. Fewer will come from lesser known sites that would still be of interest to job seekers. What I want to be able to do is to collect domains and subdomains. For instance, and thinking procedurally, once I have encountered and noted monster.com I want to ignore subsequence occurrences of it. I want to continue to look for distinct, new domains and subdomains.
