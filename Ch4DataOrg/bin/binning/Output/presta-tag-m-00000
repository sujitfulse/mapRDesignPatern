I searched online and found out it's called a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presta_valve&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Presta valve&lt;/a&gt;, and it's pretty common and popular. I'm finding it annoying and fiddly and don't know how to use it properly. I have a floor pump, and I know the valves and pump are fine, because the guy in the shop had no trouble using the same one. But after reading online and watching YouTube videos I still can't figure out how to do it properly!  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here's what I'm trying:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Rotate wheel so that the pump can comfortably reach the valve (guides online say the valve should be at 12 o'clock position, but I can't do that because the hose on the pump isn't long enough)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Remove valve cap, unscrew thingy in valve, and tap it a little - a jet of air shoots out. OK.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Push pump onto valve. This is where I get into trouble...&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I can't seem to get the attachment onto the valve in the right way. I'm pushing it on with the elbow lever thingy down, and then pulling the lever up as you can see in the pictures, to make the attachment grip onto the valve.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, either it flops around loose and leaks air out the sides (when I push it on gently), or sometimes it goes on but then the tire doesn't seem to inflate any, the pump just gets stiff really quickly as if the valve was blocked - then I remove the attachment and it goes pffffft like all the pressure was just backed up in the hose and not actually going into the tire.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was able to pump up the tire eventually, but it took me about an hour of stuffing around and my &quot;project manager&quot; got angry, because I was supposed to be in the kitchen making her a salad, not mucking around in the garage.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The time I got it on properly I had to deflate the tire completely, and even then it was difficult because with the tire completely deflated the stem of the valve just pushed into the rim. Surely this is not normal? What's the trick of attaching the darned thing?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, how can I just check the pressure? When I attach the thing I expect the guage to jump up and show me what pressure it's at, but it just stays at 0.
